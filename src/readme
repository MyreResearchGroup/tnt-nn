In this directory you should find tnt-nn.m, the source file for the TNT-NN method.

Run this matlab script as:
x = tnt-nn(A, b);

where A is the m x n matrix representing the system of equations, b is the 
solution column vector (length m) of measured data, and x is the column 
vector (length n) of parameters obtained to best fit the solution vector and 
minimize the 2-norm of the solution residual.

Additional parameters that can be supplied to tnt-nn() include:
lambda: the Tikhonov regularization parameter
rel_tol: a relative tolerance for comparaing solution improvement
AA: the precalculated normal equations
use_AA: a flag indicating to use AA (when set to 1)
red_c: reduction constant for the active set
exp_c: expansion constant for the active set
